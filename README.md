PDF and CDF Visualization of Iris Dataset
Overview
This project analyzes the Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the Iris dataset. It focuses on the petal length distribution for three species of iris flowers:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Using Matplotlib and NumPy, we visualize both PDF and CDF for each species, helping to understand the data distribution better.
